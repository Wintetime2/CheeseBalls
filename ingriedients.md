Potato – This is one of those vegetables, that is liked by everyone, from adults to kids. And when it is combined with cheese, it just gets better.

Cheese – Here, I have used a combination of two, Cheddar Cheese and Mozzarella Cheese. If you can’t find Cheddar Cheese, you can make it with just Mozzarella too.

Paneer – Along with Potatoes, I also add Paneer. It adds to the creamy texture of these Cheesy Balls.

For Slurry – We will make an all-purpose flour slurry, which is made for the outer layer of these crispy balls.

Bread Crumbs – This is the ingredient that makes these balls crispy from outside. Once the balls are ready, they are rolled into a slurry and then these Breadcrumbs to get that crunchy outside layer.

Other Ingredients – We will need some more ingredients such as Coriander Leaves, Salt, Garam Masala Powder and Oil.

You can use any vegetable oil, to deep fry these Cheesy Balls.
