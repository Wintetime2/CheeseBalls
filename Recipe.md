Step By Step Recipe
Mix potato, paneer, cheese, salt, coriander, cornflour, and garam masala in a bowl.

Take a small amount of the mixture and make it into a round. Flatten the round and keep a tsp of mozzarella cheese in the center.

Bring the ends together and make into a ball again. Make all the balls in the same manner. Refrigerate the balls of 30 minutes.

In another bowl add all-purpose flour and add water to make a thin paste.

Dip the balls in the flour paste and then roll them in the bread crumbs.

Deep fry on medium heat until golden brown. Remove on a plate lined with a kitchen towel.
